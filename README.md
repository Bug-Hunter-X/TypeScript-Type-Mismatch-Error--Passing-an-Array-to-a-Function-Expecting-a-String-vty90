This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array to a function expecting a string. The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version. The error arises from a type mismatch between the function's expected parameter type and the actual argument type.  The solution shows how to handle this by either changing the function signature to accept arrays or modifying how the array is passed to the function.
